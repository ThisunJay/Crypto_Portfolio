bodies to name a few. The developed system gives users the ability to keep track of their cryptocurrency
wallet summary in an easy way. Using Google authentication and Coinbase authentication the system
gets the cryptocurrency wallet balance summary from the user and uploads it to their google drive so
that the customers will have proof of their wallet history.
